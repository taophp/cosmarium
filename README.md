# Cosmarium

**Cosmarium** is a next-generation creative writing software designed for fiction authors (novels, short stories, novellas, long-form series) who want power, modularity, speed, and immersion.
Inspired by the best development (Zed, VS Code) and writing tools (FocusWriter, Manuskript, Scrivener), Cosmarium puts modularity, ergonomics, and openness at the heart of its architecture.

## ‚ú® Vision

- **Write without friction**: a lightweight, fast, immersive interface that disappears in front of your text.
- **Organize and connect everything**: entities, timelines, places, objects, notes, goals, versions‚Ä¶ everything is accessible, structured, and interconnected.
- **Total modularity**: every feature is a module, enable/disable as you wish, extensible via plugins.
- **Open to AI and modern tools**: narrative assistants, style analysis, sound and graphic generation, MuseTag integration.
- **Collaboration and community**: write solo or together, share, discuss, and grow as a group.

## üöÄ Main Features

- **Immersive markdown editor** (inspired by Zed/FocusWriter) with optional preview.
- **Modular panels**: entities (characters, places, objects‚Ä¶), timeline, notes, goals, statistics, etc.
- **Integrated versioning and branching** (git-like, but internal and transparent).
- **Project = compressed file or structured folder** (user choice).
- **Export**: Markdown, PDF, TXT, HTML, Word, LaTeX.
- **Advanced statistics**: quantity, quality, style analysis, word frequency, sentence length, etc.
- **Writing goals**: progress tracking, notifications, history.
- **Immersive mode**: configurable panels, AI-generated soundscape, dynamic graphic backgrounds.
- **Conversational AI panel**: discuss your story, unlock inspiration, structure your plot.
- **Plugin architecture**: narrative assistants (Snowflake method, narrative templates‚Ä¶), analysis tools, community extensions.
- **Real-time collaboration**: co-writing, comments, access rights management.
- **Community panels**: forums, thematic chat rooms, project sharing.
